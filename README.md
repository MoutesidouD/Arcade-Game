# Arcade Game


## Description

This is an arcade game I created, using a starter project provided by Udacity,including game engine and resources.

## Instructions

The game is a classic arcade game.
There are 3 bug enemies, running at random speed and a player's character.
Using the arrow keys on keyboard,player should avoid colliding with these enemies and reach the water on the top of the screen.
Once this happens,player is set back to start and the game restarts.
